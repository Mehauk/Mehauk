# Hi, Iâ€™m Noor
Professionaly I am a Full-Stack Engineer, with great expertise developing cross-platform mobile applications. On my off time, I like to delve into new programming languages as it forces me to solve problems using various paradigms. I am currently working on a machine learning project written in rust to get a better understanding of AI (I was intrigued by chatGPT).
